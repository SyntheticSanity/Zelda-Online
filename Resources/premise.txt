A great blight has entered the heavens. The sages, fighting a losing battle
against evil, use their powers to bring forth the heroes spread througout time
into their domain, and seek their aid in defeating the source of the scurge.

Heroes from all throughout the history of Hyrule are called upon, and find
themselves pulled through time and space into the heavenly realm of the sages,
only to find out that a great battle is taking place, and that the safety of
all time and space rests with the heroes.

Summoning the heroes uses most of the sages' power, and unable to aid directly
in the coming battles, the heroes are forced to fight through the hoardes of
monsters plaguing the realm, and free the heavens of the blight once and for
all, to return safely back to their time and defeat the evil forces already
facing them there.

Each of the temples to the sages are under an imminent threat of distruction,
leading to the loss of the source of each sage's divine power. As the heroes
fight their way through the hoardes, a combination of evil power at the origin
of the heroes, and the damage to the temples, the power of the sages will often
wayne, and one or more of the heroes will be flung back into their own time, in
which they must fight to survive and continue to rid their own world of evil
before being brought back to the sage realm.
